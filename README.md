Write a program which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest number of Push_swap instruction language that
sorts the integer arguments received.
you have 2 stacks a and b, the stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers
which cannot be duplicated.
The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a.
To do this you have the following operations:

sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there
is only one or no elements).
sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there
is only one or no elements).
ss : sa and sb at the same time.
pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
nothing if b is empty.
pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
nothing if a is empty.
ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element
becomes the first one.
rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element
becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
